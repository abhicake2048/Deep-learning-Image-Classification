# Image classification using deep learning

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for classifying images of different types of vegetables. Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision, and by training a deep learning model on a dataset of vegetable images, we can create a system capable of accurately identifying and categorizing various vegetables.
## Features

- Dataset Preparation : The project includes scripts for collecting and preprocessing a dataset of vegetable images suitable for model training.
- Diversability : The project cab be trained on set of dataset. The dataset folder just has to have three folder : "Train","Test","Validation".
- Model Architecture : We employ state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically designed for image classification tasks.
- Training and Evaluation : The model is trained using from scratch techniques and evaluated on a test dataset to assess its performance and accuracy.
- Deployment : Once trained, the model can be deployed for real-world applications, such as vegetable recognition in agricultural automation systems or food recognition in mobile apps.
